# Code Quality Tools Setup

This document summarizes the code quality tools that have been set up for this project and identifies issues that still need to be addressed.

## Tools Implemented

1. **Dependency Management**

   - **npm-check-updates**: Installed for checking outdated dependencies
   - **Dependabot**: Configured in `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates
   - **Depcheck**: Already installed for identifying unused dependencies

2. **Code Linting & Formatting**

   - **ESLint**: Already configured with TypeScript support
   - **Prettier**: Already configured for code formatting
   - **Biome**: Already configured as a modern JavaScript/TypeScript toolchain
   - **Husky**: Set up for pre-commit hooks
   - **lint-staged**: Configured to run linters and formatters on staged files before committing

3. **Security**

   - **Snyk**: Installed for security vulnerability scanning
   - **npm audit**: Already available for checking package vulnerabilities
   - **Security Policy**: Created in `SECURITY.md`

4. **CI/CD**

   - **GitHub Actions**: Enhanced existing workflow with dependency scanning and security checks

5. **Documentation**
   - **Code Quality Documentation**: Created in `doc/code-quality.md`
   - **Maintenance Script**: Created in `scripts/maintain-code-quality.ts`

## Issues to Address

1. **Test Configuration**

   - The Jest tests are failing due to TypeScript and React JSX syntax issues
   - Need to update Jest configuration to properly handle TypeScript and React

2. **Build Process**

   - The bundle analysis is failing with "Could not resolve entry module 'index.html'"
   - Need to check the Vite configuration for the analyze mode

3. **TypeScript Type Errors**
   - Several TypeScript errors in test files need to be fixed

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Jest Configuration**

   - Update the Jest configuration to properly handle TypeScript and React JSX
   - Fix the type errors in test files

2. **Fix Build Process**

   - Update the Vite configuration for bundle analysis

3. **Run Tests**

   - Once the configuration is fixed, run the tests to ensure they pass

4. **Complete Security Scanning**
   - Set up Snyk token for GitHub Actions

## Usage

The following scripts have been added to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "update:deps": "npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install",
    "security:check": "npm audit && npx snyk test",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "fix:all": "npm run lint:fix && npm run format && npx @biomejs/biome check --apply .",
    "maintain": "tsx scripts/maintain-code-quality.ts"
  }
}
```

To run the comprehensive maintenance script:

```sh
npm run maintain
```

This script will:

1. Create a backup of the project
2. Check for outdated and unused dependencies
3. Run linting and formatting
4. Perform type checking
5. Run tests
6. Analyze bundle size
7. Check for security vulnerabilities
