# Color Palette Generator Implementation

## Overview

The Color Palette Generator is a feature that allows users to create harmonious color schemes for their AI agents. It includes a robust set of utilities for generating color harmonies, variations, and ensuring accessibility, as well as a visual interface for previewing and applying color palettes to the application theme.

## Features

### Color Harmony Generation

- **Complementary Colors**: Generates colors from opposite sides of the color wheel
- **Analogous Colors**: Creates harmonious color schemes using adjacent colors on the color wheel
- **Triadic Colors**: Produces balanced color schemes using three colors equidistant on the color wheel

### Color Variations

- **Shades**: Darker variations of the base color
- **Tints**: Lighter variations of the base color
- **Tones**: Desaturated variations of the base color

### Accessibility Features

- **Contrast Checking**: Evaluates text/background color combinations against WCAG standards
- **Automatic Text Color**: Determines optimal text color (black or white) based on background
- **WCAG Badges**: Visual indicators showing AA/AAA compliance level

### Theme Integration

- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of how colors will appear in UI components
- **Apply to Application**: One-click application of generated palette to entire application
- **Theme Persistence**: Custom color themes are saved in localStorage

## Implementation Details

### Core Color Utilities (`color-palette.ts`)

This module provides the foundational color manipulation functions:

- Color space conversions (HEX ↔ RGB ↔ HSL)
- Color harmony generation functions
- Contrast ratio calculations
- Theme color generation from a base color

### UI Components

#### PaletteGenerator Component

An interactive interface that allows users to:
- Input a base color using a color picker or HEX value
- Generate color harmonies and variations
- Preview theme colors in a simulated UI environment
- Apply the generated palette to the application

#### ColorSwatch Component

A reusable component that:
- Displays a color sample with proper text contrast
- Shows accessibility compliance badges
- Provides copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Handles selection states

### Theme Provider Enhancement

The existing theme system was extended to support:
- Custom theme option beyond just light/dark/system
- Setting and persisting custom color variables
- Determining appropriate base theme (light/dark) for custom colors

## Integration Points

- **Routing**: Added to main application router
- **Navigation**: Added to sidebar menu under UI Demos
- **Dashboard**: Linked from the dashboard UI Demos section
- **Theme System**: Integrated with the existing theme provider

## Future Enhancements

- Save and load multiple color palettes
- Export color palettes to different formats (CSS, SCSS, JSON)
- Color blindness simulation
- More advanced color harmony options (split complementary, etc.)
- Agent-specific theming (each AI agent gets its own theme)

## Accessibility Considerations

The color palette generator was designed with accessibility in mind:
- All generated color combinations are evaluated for contrast
- Visual indicators show WCAG compliance level
- Text colors automatically adjust based on background
- Theme previews include real UI components to evaluate readability
