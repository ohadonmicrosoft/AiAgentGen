# Performance Monitoring System Overview

This document provides an overview of the performance monitoring system implemented in our application. The system enables real-time tracking, visualization, and analysis of performance metrics to help identify bottlenecks and optimize the user experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Real-time Metric Collection**: Automatically collects performance data as the application runs
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks FPS, memory usage, component render times, and custom operations
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive charts and tables for analyzing performance data
- **Filtering and Grouping**: Tools to filter, sort, and group metrics for easier analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: Export performance data for offline analysis or reporting

### Metric Types

- **FPS (Frames Per Second)**: Measures UI smoothness and animation performance
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks JavaScript heap memory consumption
- **Component Render Times**: Measures how long React components take to render
- **Page Load Metrics**: Captures initial page load performance
- **Custom Operation Timing**: Allows timing of specific operations or functions
- **Long Task Detection**: Identifies tasks that block the main thread for too long

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Performance Monitor

The central utility that collects and manages performance metrics:

```typescript
// Start monitoring performance
performanceMonitor.startMonitoring();

// Record a custom metric
performanceMonitor.recordMetric("custom-operation", 150, "ms");

// Measure a function's execution time
performanceMonitor.measureFunction("data-processing", () => {
  // Function to measure
  return processData();
});
```

#### 2. React Hooks

React hooks for integrating performance monitoring into components:

```typescript
// Monitor component performance
const { metrics, trackOperation } = usePerformance({
  name: "MyComponent",
  trackRenders: true,
  trackFPS: true,
});

// Measure specific operations
const { start, end } = useOperationPerformance("MyComponent", "dataFetch");
```

### Technical Implementation

The performance monitoring system uses a combination of browser APIs and custom instrumentation:

1. **Performance API**: Uses the browser's Performance API for accurate timing
2. **RequestAnimationFrame**: Measures FPS by counting frames over time
3. **IntersectionObserver**: Efficiently detects when elements enter the viewport
4. **React Lifecycle Integration**: Hooks into React's rendering cycle for component metrics
5. **Event-based Architecture**: Uses a publish-subscribe pattern for metric collection and notification

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring

```typescript
// Initialize monitoring for the entire application
import { initializePerformanceMonitoring } from "@/hooks/use-performance";

const { stopMonitoring, getMetrics, clearMetrics } =
  initializePerformanceMonitoring();
```

### Component Performance Tracking

```typescript
import { usePerformance } from '@/hooks/use-performance';

function MyComponent() {
  const { trackOperation, isTracking } = usePerformance({
    name: 'MyComponent',
    trackRenders: true
  });

  const handleClick = () => {
    trackOperation('buttonClick', () => {
      // Operation to measure
      processData();
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Process Data</button>;
}
```

### Async Operation Tracking

```typescript
import { usePerformance } from "@/hooks/use-performance";

function DataList() {
  const { trackAsyncOperation } = usePerformance({ name: "DataList" });

  const fetchData = async () => {
    return trackAsyncOperation("fetchData", async () => {
      const response = await fetch("/api/data");
      return response.json();
    });
  };
}
```

## Integration with Other Systems

The performance monitoring system integrates with:

- **Infinite Scroll**: Monitors scroll performance and loading times
- **Animation System**: Tracks FPS during animations to ensure smoothness
- **Data Fetching**: Measures API request times and processing
- **State Management**: Can track state update performance
- **Error Tracking**: Correlates performance issues with errors

## Performance Considerations

- **Low Overhead**: The monitoring system is designed to have minimal impact on application performance
- **Conditional Activation**: Can be enabled only in development or for specific users
- **Sampling**: For high-frequency events, sampling can be used to reduce overhead
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of listeners and observers to prevent memory leaks

## Best Practices

- **Establish Baselines**: Measure performance before and after changes to identify improvements or regressions
- **Focus on User Experience**: Prioritize metrics that directly impact user experience (FPS, interaction latency)
- **Set Performance Budgets**: Define acceptable thresholds for key metrics
- **Regular Monitoring**: Incorporate performance monitoring into development workflow
- **Test on Representative Devices**: Test on devices that match your target audience's hardware

## Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard is available at `/performance-dashboard` that provides:

- Real-time performance monitoring
- Historical data visualization
- Metric filtering and grouping
- Component-level performance analysis
- Raw data export for further analysis
