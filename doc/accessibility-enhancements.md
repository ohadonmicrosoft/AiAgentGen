# Accessibility Enhancements

This document outlines the accessibility enhancements implemented in the AI Agent Generator application to ensure it is usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities.

## Overview

Our accessibility improvements follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level. We've focused on making the application usable with assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other input methods.

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Enhanced the sidebar component with proper ARIA attributes (`aria-current`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to improve navigation for screen reader users.
- **Focus Management**: Implemented a focus trap utility that keeps focus within modal dialogs and prevents users from accidentally tabbing into the background content.
- **Skip Links**: Added a skip link component that allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to the main content.

### 2. Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA Attributes**: Added appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties throughout the application:
  - `aria-label` for buttons without visible text
  - `aria-current="page"` for active navigation items
  - `aria-expanded` for collapsible elements
  - `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements
  - `role="menu"` and `role="menuitem"` for navigation menus
- **Announcer Component**: Implemented a screen reader announcer that provides context for dynamic content changes, such as:
  - Form submission results
  - Loading states
  - Error messages
  - Navigation changes

### 3. Focus Management

- **Modal Dialogs**: Enhanced both the `Dialog` and `AlertDialog` components with:
  - Focus trapping within the dialog
  - Automatic focus on the first interactive element
  - Restoration of focus when the dialog closes
  - Proper handling of the Escape key
- **Dynamic Content**: Implemented focus management for dynamically loaded content to ensure users don't lose their place when content changes.

### 4. Semantic HTML

- **Proper Heading Structure**: Ensured a logical heading hierarchy throughout the application.
- **Semantic Elements**: Used appropriate HTML elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.
- **Form Labels**: Ensured all form controls have associated labels.

### 5. Visual Considerations

- **Color Contrast**: Verified that all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements.
- **Focus Indicators**: Enhanced focus styles to ensure they are clearly visible.
- **Reduced Motion**: Added support for the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to respect user preferences for reduced animation.

## Testing and Validation

The accessibility enhancements have been tested using:

1. **Automated Tools**:

   - Lighthouse
   - axe DevTools
   - WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Screen reader testing with NVDA and VoiceOver
   - Testing with various browser and screen reader combinations

## Future Improvements

While we've made significant progress, we plan to continue improving accessibility with:

1. **Regular Audits**: Conducting periodic accessibility audits as new features are added.
2. **User Testing**: Gathering feedback from users with disabilities.
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Providing accessibility documentation for developers to maintain and improve accessibility.
